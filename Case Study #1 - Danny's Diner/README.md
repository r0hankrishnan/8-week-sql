## Business Case
Danny's Diner is a small restaurant that serve three dishes -- sushi, curry, and ramen. They have collected several months of operational data that he wants to use to answer some key questions about his business. Namely, he wants to know how much money customers are spending, whether he should expand the customer loyalty program, what the main customer visiting patterns are, and what dishes are customers' favorites. He also wants to be able to create some data sets for his team so they do not need to use SQL.
