# SELECT STAR SQL NOTES

As I work through the 8-week challenge, I will be using the online book [Select Star SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/) to learn the fundamental syntax and thought-process behind SQL. This notes folder will hold my notes and my work for the in-book projects. 

## Table Used In Select Star SQL
The table used in the book is a data set made by the autor, [Zi Chong Kao](https://kaomorphism.com/), that contains Texas deathrow inmates executed from 1976 onwards. Its structure is shown below:

| first_name (STR) | last_name (STR) | ex_number (NUM) | ex_age (NUM) | ex_date (DATE) | county (STR) | last_statement (STR) | 
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
